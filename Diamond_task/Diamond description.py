# Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, 
# and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.

# Task
# You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape 
# when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. 

# Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

# Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, 
# as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

#  *
# ***
#  *

# ...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"
